Mobber Site Recreation
======

After a single day of HTML and CSS practice, our assignment was to recreate - pixel perfect - a .png image of a website called Mobber.

Looking back on it now, the majority of the HTML and CSS used to accomplish this is painful to look at, often needing to coerce elements into position in very inelegant ways. Even in its 'finished' state, I would never assert that this is a 'pixel perfect' recreation of the site. That said, it's serviceable - just don't look behind the curtain too long :)

Granted, this is pre-SASS/grid-system familiarity, but it's still no excuse for the spaghetti CSS.

I'll leave it as is for the sake of showing how much less I suck at CSS now.
